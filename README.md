DOM is the Source of Truth

ALPHA DEVELOPMENT

Front-End JS applications should hold a little state as possible. All data should be kept in the DOM (in elements and data-attributes). MutationObservers and event handlers should be the entry point for domain application events which should, individually, consider the DOM as a static, but mutable resource on which on they interact.
